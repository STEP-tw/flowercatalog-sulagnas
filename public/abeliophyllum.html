  <b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic<br> genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of<br> one species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea, where<br> it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is<br> related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.

  It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are<br> opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both<br> above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new<br> leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-<br>lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.

  It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
