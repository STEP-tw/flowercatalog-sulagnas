  They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in.<br> The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The<br> margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact<br> clusters.

  The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and<br> spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
